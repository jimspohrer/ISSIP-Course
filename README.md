# ISSIP-Course
Working with student teams at various universities to learn to use AI in building an on-boarding course for new ISSIP participants.

ISSIP (https://www.issip.org) is a non-profit professional association for sharing knowledge about service innovation, service science, Service-Dominant (S-D) logic, and Service Dominant Architecture (SDA).

One of ISSIP programs is the AI Collab (Academic-Industry) Collaboration Projects.   Students teams work with industry mentors to create deliverables and earn an ISSIP Digital Certification to post on their LinkedIn profile if they would like to do so.

For example, some past projects include:

2023 Fall: Use AI to make Service Innovation Case Studies: https://issip.org/2023/12/14/2023-collab-generative-ai-and-historic-service-innovations/
